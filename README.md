# JBNU Web Service Project
*A web service design project inspired by the game Wordle. Players must guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, letters are marked to show which ones are correct and in the right position, helping players narrow down the solution. Each player can create an account and see his rank among all players.*
